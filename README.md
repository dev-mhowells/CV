## Michael Howells - [Portfolio Site](https://michaeldhowells.netlify.app/)

I love working on things which are meaningful and provide real value to end users. My personal projects have focused on applying my previous experience as a language teacher to the e-learning space by developing web apps which make online learning more interactive.  I also hold an MSc in psychology, where my research focused on the intersection of psychology and technology, and where my love of programming began.

| **Bakery Management System**        |  A full-stack MVP for an e-commerce system developed from scratch with a small team of 6 developers following Agile development methodology. The app allows wholesale clients to order from a bakery. The bakery’s dashboard allows management of incoming orders and uploading and editing of items to display on the storefront. Wholesale clients are able to place orders, check-out and view invoices.  | Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Firebase storage, Cypress, Jest | [GitHub](https://github.com/dev-mhowells/bakery-manager-refactor) |
| **English Deck**            | An interactive e-learning application. Consists of a number of functional elements including flashcards, quizzes, drag and drop activities, user authentication, and comment sections. I also built a custom content management system in order to update and edit all of the content on the site, including both the articles and interactive components.  | HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Firebase | [GitHub - Site](https://github.com/dev-mhowells/English-Deck-Site)<br>  [GitHub - CMS](https://github.com/dev-mhowells/English-Deck-CMS)<br>  [Live site](https://english-articles-35937.web.app) |
| **Language Correction Messenger** |  Allows language learners to converse with teachers via a messenger designed to enable seamless integration of corrections and learning opportunities. Teachers are able to correct messages sent by students. Students can request additional information on vocabulary used in messages sent by teachers, including audio for pronunciation. | HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Firebase | [GitHub](https://github.com/dev-mhowells/messaging-app) [Live site](https://messenger-32231.web.app/)

## Work Experience

**Labs English Academy** (January 2017 to June 2020)  
_English Language Teacher_

- Taught business, academic and conversational English to adults in both English and Korean.
- Delivered interactive classes with students from a wide range of educational, social, and cultural backgrounds.
- Regularly met with students and staff members to report on learning goals and to ensure they were being met.
- Worked independently and with other teachers to source and adapt learning materials which could be tailored to specific use cases and individual students.

## Skills

#### I love simplifying complexity

One of the most rewarding aspects of programming for me is approaching a new technology or complex code base and working on breaking down and digesting that complexity. This is something that I did countless times in my previous career as an English language teacher where I was required to break down and teach complex grammar rules to learners of all levels. It was also necessary when writing up literature reviews and research which I conducted during my master’s degree, especially when it came to highly technical topics in neuropsychology and detailing quantitative research methods and results. This skill has most benefited me while planning out complex database structures, communicating technical ideas while working in Agile development environments, and when learning new frameworks. It has also proved useful in a recent presentation I delivered detailing the process of creating an e-commerce site MVP to a non-technical audience, where I managed to convey some of the complexities of working with databases and online storage.

#### I predict problems

While solving problems is the main job of a software developer, I have found that often spending the time to predict and prepare for problems before they occur is both time efficient and produces higher quality outcomes. This is an approach I began to adopt most seriously as a teacher where the inability to predict potential problems students may encounter in the classroom could mean disaster for the flow of the lesson and learning outcomes. More recently I continued to develop this approach while conducting research, where it was important to be able to predict potential problems with participant recruitment and experiment design. In software development this has taken the form of extensive whiteboarding, seeking feedback from peers and more experienced developers, and thinking more carefully about higher level decision making.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (November 2022 to February 2023)

- Worked with test driven development using RSpec and Jest for integration and unit testing on a number of projects with CRUD functionality. Also worked with Cypress for component testing in React.
- Followed Agile methodology while working in teams with other developers while developing full-stack applications from scratch, as well as from existing code bases.
- Developed a strong understanding of Object Oriented Programming principles through a variety of projects and challenges in both Ruby and JavaScript. 
- Worked with closely with PostgreSQL and MondgoDB. The former in conjunction with Ruby and Sinatra for an Airbnb clone. The later in two larger MERN stack projects.
- Became very comfortable creating and working on REST APIs using Node.js and Express.

#### University of Derby (Graduated August 2021)

- MSc Psychology (Distinction)
- Research focused on the relationship between psychology and technology. Specifically, the relationship between behavioural addiction, decision making, and online spending.
- Conceptualised and completed ambitious research projects both independently and as part of a team.
- Wrote up highly detailed reports written for a technical audience on complex topics in neuropsychology and cognitive psychology.
- Knowledgeable and competent in areas related to statistical analysis and specialist statistical software.

## What I'm working on now

I recently used the MERN stack to create a rough MVC for a social networking site for language learners which allows users to make grammar corrections to each other’s posts [GitHub](https://github.com/dev-mhowells/language-exchange-app). To handle authentication I went through the process of building an auth solution from scratch using Bcrypt and JSON web tokens. However, I really like the concept of the app and see myself working on it for some time and hopefully shipping it. As such, I’m planning to use the project to push myself to learn about new technologies and more secure auth solutions. My plan for the next while is to convert the project into a Next.js app with Typescript and integrate some of the features I built from a previous messaging app project! 

## Hobbies

 I like chess, martial arts, and Japanese literature! I also speak Korean at a conversational level.
