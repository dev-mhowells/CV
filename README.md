## Michael Howells

I love working on things which are meaningful and provide real value to end users. My personal projects have focused on  applying my experience as an ex-language teacher to the e-learning space by developing web apps which make online learning more interactive.  I also hold an MSc in psychology, where my research focused on the intersection of psychology and
technology, and where my love of programming began.
