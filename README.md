## Michael Howells

I love working on things which are meaningful and provide real value to end users. My personal projects have focused on applying my previous experience as a language teacher to the e-learning space by developing web apps which make online learning more interactive.  I also hold an MSc in psychology, where my research focused on the intersection of psychology and technology, and where my love of programming began.

| **Bakery Management System**        |  A full-stack MVP for an e-commerce system developed from scratch with a small team of 6 developers following Agile development methodology. The app allows wholesale clients to order from a bakery. The bakery’s dashboard allows management of incoming orders and uploading and editing of items to display on the storefront. Wholesale clients are able to place orders, check-out and view invoices.  | Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Firebase storage, Cypress, Jest | [GitHub](https://github.com/dev-mhowells/bakery-manager-refactor) |
| **English Deck**            | An interactive e-learning application. Consists of a number of functional elements including flashcards, quizzes, user authentication, and comment sections. I also built a custom content management system in order to update and edit all of the content on the site, including both the articles and interactive components.  | HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Firebase | [GitHub - Site](https://github.com/dev-mhowells/English-Deck-Site) [GitHub - CMS](https://github.com/dev-mhowells/English-Deck-CMS) [Live site](https://english-articles-35937.web.app) |
| **Language correction messenger** |  Allows language learners to converse with teachers via a messenger designed to enable seamless integration of corrections and learning opportunities. Teachers are able to correct messages sent by students. Students can request additional information on vocabulary used in messages sent by teachers, including audio for pronunciation. | HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Firebase | [GitHub](https://github.com/dev-mhowells/messaging-app) [Live site](https://messenger-32231.web.app/)

## Work Experience

**Labs English Academy** (January 2017 to June 2020)  
_English Language Teacher_

- Taught business, academic and conversational English to adults in both English and Korean.
- Delivered interactive classes with students from a wide range of educational, social, and cultural backgrounds.
- Regularly met with students and staff members to report on learning goals and to ensure they were being met.
- Worked independently and with other teachers to source and adapt learning materials which could be tailored to specific use cases and individual students.

## Skills

#### I pull out all the stops to get things done

- While an important part of project planning is predicting potential problems, unexpected roadblocks often occur. I enjoy problem solving and coming up with solutions in the heat of the moment to ensure deadlines can be met.
- While conducting research as part of my master’s degree, we were having problems with participant engagement with the study. Participants completing the study online were often getting most of the way through the task but dropping out before reaching the end. After checking the data to find out where the dropout point was, it became clear that the task was not streamlined well enough and that it was likely that participants were simply unaware that there was more to the study. I adjusted the task instructions to indicate more clearly exactly what the stages of the study were, and I contacted a member of the IT team to see if it was possible for participants to be automatically redirected to the next step of the study rather than physically having to click through to it themselves. After making these changes, the dropout rate reduced to almost zero and we were back on track to acquire enough data for the study to proceed.

#### I enjoy learning about technical things

- I was once required to write up a comprehensive summary of an area of neuropsychology which I was not knowledgeable about. The report was to be aimed at experts in the field, and I was required to adhere to a very specific outline in accordance with standards set out by the British Psychological Society. 
- To ensure I was able to produce something of exceptional standard, I began working on the assignment early, reading all of the seminal papers published in the area and keeping careful notes and memorising definitions of technical jargon. I broke the assignment up into manageable sections and branched out into more specific and up to date research to ensure that the work was detailed and current in its use of empirical evidence and points of contention within the field. It was quite daunting to be expected to deliver work aimed at experts in such a technical field, however, I remained consistent in my efforts and was confident that by dedicating enough time to the assignment, I would be able to complete it to a high standard. Ultimately, my efforts to meet the task requirements resulted in achieving a grade within the highest possible tier. 

## Education

#### Makers Academy (November 2022 to February 2023)

- Worked with test driven development using RSpec and Jest for integration and unit testing on a number of projects with CRUD functionality. Also worked with Cypress for component testing in React.
- Followed Agile methodology while working in teams with other developers while developing full-stack applications from scratch, as well as from existing code bases.
- Developed a strong understanding of Object Oriented Programming principles through a variety of projects and challenges in both Ruby and JavaScript. 
- Worked with closely with PostgreSQL and MondgoDB. The former in conjunction with Ruby and Sinatra for an Airbnb clone. The later in two larger MERN stack projects.
- Became very comfortable creating and working on REST APIs using Node.js and Express.

#### University of Derby (Graduated August 2021)

- MSc Psychology (Distinction)
- Research focused on the relationship between psychology and technology. Specifically, the relationship between behavioural addiction, decision making, and online spending.
- Conceptualised and completed ambitious research projects both independently and as part of a team.
- Wrote up highly detailed reports written for a technical audience on complex topics in neuropsychology and cognitive psychology.
- Knowledgeable and competent in areas related to statistical analysis and specialist statistical software.

## What I'm working on now

I recently used the MERN stack to create a rough MVC for a social networking site for language learners which allows users to make grammar corrections to each other’s posts [GitHub](https://github.com/dev-mhowells/language-exchange-app). To handle authentication I went through the process of building an auth solution from scratch using Bcrypt and JSON web tokens. However, I really like the concept of the app and see myself working on it for some time and hopefully shipping it. As such, I’m planning to use the project to push myself to learn about new technologies and more secure auth solutions. My plan for the next while is to convert the project into a Next.js app with Typescript and integrate some of the features I built from a previous messaging app project! 

## Hobbies

 I like chess, martial arts, and Japanese literature! I also speak Korean at a conversational level.
