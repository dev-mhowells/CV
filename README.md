## Michael Howells

I love working on things which are meaningful and provide real value to end users. My personal projects have focused on  applying my experience as an ex-language teacher to the e-learning space by developing web apps which make online learning more interactive.  I also hold an MSc in psychology, where my research focused on the intersection of psychology and
technology, and where my love of programming began.

## Projects

| Name                         | Description       | Tech/tools        |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| **English Deck**            | An interactive e-learning application. Consists of a number of functional elements including flashcards, quizzes, user authentication, and comment sections.

| **Language correction messenger** |  Allows language learners to converse with teachers via a messenger designed to enable seamless integration of corrections and learning opportunities. Teachers are able to correct messages sent by students. Students can request additional information on vocabulary used in messages sent by teachers, including audio for pronunciation. | HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Firebase |

## Work Experience

**Labs English Academy** (January 2017 to June 2020)  
_English Language Teacher_

- Taught business, academic and conversational English to adults in both English and Korean.
- Delivered interactive classes with students from a wide range of educational, social, and cultural backgrounds.
- Regularly met with students and staff members to report on learning goals and to ensure they were being met.
- Worked independently and with other teachers to source and adapt learning materials which could be tailored to specific use cases and individual students.

## Skills

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider your best skills. Pick 2-4 skills and write a short descriptive paragraph for each one. You should demonstrate how capable you are at this skill with examples.
(Using a STAR example Paragraph) Consider the questions below.

-STAR
-What was the situation/task? (ST)

-How was the skill used?

-What did you do? (action)

-What was the result?


#### I pull out all the stops to get things done

- While an important part of project planning is predicting potential problems, unexpected roadblocks often occur. I enjoy problem solving and coming up with solutions in the heat of the moment to ensure deadlines can be met.
- While conducting research as part of my Masterâ€™s degree, we were having problems with participant engagement with the study. Participants completing the study online were often getting most of the way through the task but dropping out before reaching the end. After checking the data to find out where the dropout point was, it became clear that the task was not streamlined well enough and that it was likely that participants were simply unaware that there was more to the study. I adjusted the task instructions to indicate more clearly exactly what the stages of the study were, and I contacted a member of the IT team to see if it was possible for participants to be automatically redirected to the next step of the study rather than physically having to click through to it themselves. After making these changes, the dropout rate reduced to almost zero and we were back on track to acquire enough data for the study to proceed.

#### Another Skill

Descriptive paragraph of how capable you are at this skill and, if relevant, how it has developed (again use STAR for this)

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)

## Education

#### Makers Academy (start_date to end_date)
- Use short descriptions of what you did and a skill you used. (Similar to format from the 'Work Experience' section above)
- e.g Frequently used paring in order to problemsolve effeciently, requiring teamwork and communication.
- you might also mention aspects some other skills/knowledge listed below: 
- OOP, TDD, MVC, DDD
- Agile/XP
- Ruby, Rails, JavaScript
- RSpec, Jasmine

#### University of Derby (Graduated August 2021)

- MSc Psychology (Distinction)
- Research focused on the relationship between psychology and technology. Specifically, the relationship between behavioural addiction, decision making, and online spending.
- Conceptualised and completed ambitious research projects both independently and as part of a team.
- Wrote up highly detailed reports written for a technical audience on complex topics in neuropsychology and cognitive psychology.
- Knowledgeable and competent in areas related to statistical analysis and specialist statistical software.

## Hobbies

 I like chess, martial arts, and Japanese literature! I also speak Korean at a conversational level.
